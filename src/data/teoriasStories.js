    content: "One day I was going to a city called Jardim. To get there, we had to go through a mountain range, the Serra de Maracaju. Because of a very sharp curve, many accidents happen there; cars and trucks fall and stay there. They always say you can't go through that mountain range at night. On a trip with my sister and uncles, we passed through there at night. The car's headlights hit him, and I saw a man, barefoot, in jeans and a blue shirt. The car passed right next to him; he was on the shoulder of the road. Any town would be kilometers away, so there wouldn't be anyone there on foot. So I asked my uncles if there might have been a broken-down car nearby. They said no and asked me why. I said, 'Because of that man.' Then they said, 'What man? There's nobody there.' But my sister also saw him and described him exactly as I saw him.",
