    content: "One day I was going to a city called Jardim. To get there, we had to go through a mountain range, the Serra de Maracaju. Because of a very sharp curve, many accidents happen there; cars and trucks fall and stay there. They always say you can't go through that mountain range at night. On a trip with my sister and uncles, we passed through there at night. The car's headlights hit him, and I saw a man, barefoot, in jeans and a blue shirt. The car passed right next to him; he was on the shoulder of the road. Any town would be kilometers away, so there wouldn't be anyone there on foot. So I asked my uncles if there might have been a broken-down car nearby. They said no and asked me why. I said, 'Because of that man.' Then they said, 'What man? There's nobody there.' But my sister also saw him and described him exactly as I saw him.",

    content: "My grandfather was at the port of Tallinn that morning. People were boarding the ship. He saw soldiers loading something onto one part of the ship; it looked like they were arranging cargo, but it was a civilian ship. He had a bad feeling and didn't board. Hours later, the ship sank, killing 852 people. Besides him, other people also witnessed it. The ship was sabotaged. Some who tried to tell the story disappeared. A helicopter would appear, the person would be taken away, and never seen again. My grandfather was scared and didn't want to tell what he saw for a long time.",

    content: "In January 1996, the city of Varginha seemed strangely silent. Residents commented that, hours earlier, something luminous had crossed the sky and disappeared behind the hills. Shortly after, three girls were returning home when they saw something they had never seen before: crouched near a plot of land, was a small being, with dark, shiny skin, large, reddish eyes. It seemed frightened, motionless, as if it were lost. The girls ran in panic and told what they had seen. From then on, strange things began to happen. During the night, Army trucks passed through the streets, something unusual for a small city. Witnesses say that soldiers surrounded specific areas, mainly near hospitals and remote plots of land. It was said that similar creatures had been seen in other parts of the city. In the early morning, men who did not seem like ordinary soldiers began to appear. They dressed discreetly, almost always in black, spoke little, and did not identify themselves. According to reports, they arrived along with the military and took control of the situation. Some residents claim to have seen beings being placed in closed vehicles, covered by tarpaulins, and quickly taken out of the city. Hospitals were reportedly isolated, records altered, and witnesses instructed to remain silent. The following day, authorities said nothing abnormal had occurred. No ETs, no strange objects. Just 'confusion' and 'misunderstandings.' But for those who lived through that night, the feeling was different:that something much bigger than the city had passed through and was hastily taken away. Since then, Varginha has never been the same.",
