    content: "One day I was going to a city called Jardim. To get there, we had to go through a mountain range, the Serra de Maracaju. Because of a very sharp curve, many accidents happen there; cars and trucks fall and stay there. They always say you can't go through that mountain range at night. On a trip with my sister and uncles, we passed through there at night. The car's headlights hit him, and I saw a man, barefoot, in jeans and a blue shirt. The car passed right next to him; he was on the shoulder of the road. Any town would be kilometers away, so there wouldn't be anyone there on foot. So I asked my uncles if there might have been a broken-down car nearby. They said no and asked me why. I said, 'Because of that man.' Then they said, 'What man? There's nobody there.' But my sister also saw him and described him exactly as I saw him.",

    content: "My grandfather was at the port of Tallinn that morning. People were boarding the ship. He saw soldiers loading something onto one part of the ship; it looked like they were arranging cargo, but it was a civilian ship. He had a bad feeling and didn't board. Hours later, the ship sank, killing 852 people. Besides him, other people also witnessed it. The ship was sabotaged. Some who tried to tell the story disappeared. A helicopter would appear, the person would be taken away, and never seen again. My grandfather was scared and didn't want to tell what he saw for a long time.",
