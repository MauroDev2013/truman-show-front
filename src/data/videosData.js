    resume: "The mysterious case of Gabriela Rico Jiménez is one of Mexico’s most chilling unsolved stories. In 2009, the young model from Chihuahua attended a high-profile party in Monterrey—allegedly tied to the prestigious Elite Model agency. This wasn’t just any party; it was said to host powerful businessmen, politicians, and possibly organized crime figures. Days later, Gabriela appeared in a now-infamous video outside a Monterrey hotel—barefoot, distressed, and rambling about global elites, satanic rituals, and human sacrifices. She claimed world leaders, including former U.S. President George W. Bush, took part in secret ceremonies and “ate children.” Her words were frantic and disjointed, but carried a sense of real terror. Police took her away, calling it a mental breakdown. She was never seen again. No hospital records, no official statements, no trace. Her family stayed silent, and authorities offered nothing. Many believe she stumbled onto the dark side of the modeling world—where young women are exploited and trafficked under the guise of glamour—and that her outburst was a desperate warning. Others think it was a genuine psychological crisis. But the absence of any investigation has only fueled the mystery. To this day, Gabriela’s disappearance is a haunting reminder of how someone can vanish in plain sight when power, silence, and fear converge.",

    resume: "This video shows the reasons why Sony tarnished the singer's image, starting in 1993, the feud between Michael and Sony in mid-2002, how Sony's threats to seize his music catalog forced him to return with 'This Is It' and go back to the US, and how he was murdered... later, connections were found between Michael's doctor, Conrad Murray, the record label that signed him, and P. Diddy, making the grand plan that was the singer's assassination even more apparent.",
